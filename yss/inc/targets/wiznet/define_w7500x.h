 * @brief   CMSIS Cortex-M0 Device Peripheral Access Layer Header File.
 *          This file contains all the peripheral register's definitions, bits
 *          definitions and memory mapping for W7500x devices.
 *
 *          The file is the unique include file that the application programmer
 *          is using in the C source code, usually in main.c. This file contains:
 *           - Configuration section that allows to select:
 *              - The device used in the target application
 *              - To use or not the peripheral’s drivers in application code(i.e.
 *                code will be based on direct access to peripheral’s registers
 *                rather than drivers API), this option is controlled by
 *                "#define USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER"
 *              - To change few application-specific parameters such as the HSE
 *                crystal frequency
 *           - Data structures and the address mapping for all peripherals
 *           - Peripheral's registers declarations and bits definition
 *           - Macros to access peripheral’s registers hardware
